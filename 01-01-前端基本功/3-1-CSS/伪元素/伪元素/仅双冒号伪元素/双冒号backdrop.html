    The ::backdrop pseudo-element is a box that is generated behind the full-screen element but that sits above all other content. It’s used in combination with the :fullscreen pseudo-class to change the background color of a maximized screen — in case you don’t want to go with the default black.
    Note: The ::backdrop pseudo-element requires a double colon; it doesn’t work with a single colon.
    Let’s continue our example from the :fullscreen pseudo-class.
