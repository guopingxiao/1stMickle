<p>
    The ::selection pseudo-element is used to style the portion of a document that has been highlighted.
    Until further notice, Gecko-based browsers required the prefixed version: ::-moz-selection.
    Note: Combining the prefixed and unprefixed versions in a single rule wonâ€™t work. We need to create two separate rules.
